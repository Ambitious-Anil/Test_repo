DEAR DIARY!

I got up at 7:45 am, left my dorm at 8:05 am, and finished breakfast at 8:20 am. That’s the most precise and functional schedule I’ve devised after experimenting with it for the entire term.

The first class was Statistics. We wrapped up the last bit of content and reviewed for the final exam, which is coming up this Wednesday. I also had the last lecture for the psychology class. When the professor announced “Congratulations! You’re finally done with the intro to psychology winter term 2022!”, I felt as if the ten weeks had flown by too fast.

At noon, I had lunch at LDC. I tried toasting one type of bagel for the first time. It looked plain, but I was amazed when I took my first bite. I was surprised that after living here for two terms, I could still constantly discover new things at school. That bagel literally made my day.

I took a nap after my French class. Then I visited the office of my professor from my A&I seminar in the fall term. We chatted for an hour, and it felt like reconnecting with an old friend. Those conversations always make me pleased and satisfied.

When I just didn’t want to study anymore, I started searching for food recommendations in Boston for my upcoming trip in the spring break. Looking at the delicious food pictures, I told myself once more: “Only one week left. You’re almost there.”
