DEAR DIARY!

Today is my birthday, but I’m going to reschedule it because I have two final exams coming tomorrow…

No way! I’m the type of person who prioritizes birthdays, festivals, and any important celebrations over anything, because they mean so much to me.

I woke up receiving many birthday messages from friends. In the morning, I received an email notification from the post office, and it was a birthday gift shipped by one of my best friends. In the afternoon, after we finished our meetings and group work, my friend and I walked to CakeWalk to get my birthday cake together. The chocolate cake was huge and tasted so good. As everyone, including myself, is busy with with work, we had a simple birthday party at a lounge in Cassat Hall. I am so grateful for my friends who are spared time in this hectic week preparing gifts and celebrating my birthday with me. I made many great memories today, and I’ll document them in more detail when I get time. But I have to do some more studying now—two difficult exams are coming tomorrow.
