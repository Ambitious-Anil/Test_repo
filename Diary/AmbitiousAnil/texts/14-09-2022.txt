DEAR DIARY!

As usual, I don’t have class today. So I woke up late. After a relaxing breakfast, I came back to my dorm and did some revision for the French final exam. Since it covers all things we learned during the term, I had to start early.

After that, I went to LDC for lunch with friends. I had another huge bagel, but the blueberry flavor bagel was not as good as the original. Waffle fries were good today, though the second time I went to the counter, the ketchup was used up. I enjoyed lunch anyways. I chatted about some random topics with friends and enjoyed their company.

The weather is getting much better these days. The sun was out, and the temperature was approaching 40F/5°C. My friend and I reached an agreement that students should take advantage of the weather instead of studying inside the room today. Having no place to go, we finally decided to go on a short trip to Goodhue Hall. Though the intention of the trip was to pick up her computer and notebook, we were delighted by the sun and warmth.

However, the one lesson I learned today wasnever to jump to conclusions. Late in the afternoon, the sky got dark, and it started to snow again. So I decided to go back to my dorm early in case the weather got too cold at night. A friend from Minnesota once cautioned me never to be fooled by the weather. There’s usually one more snow in April!

I didn’t do much work in the evening. It’s always hard for me to stay focused the day before the exam. I skimmed through my notes for Statistics and practiced my French presentation again. Hope everything goes well tomorrow.
